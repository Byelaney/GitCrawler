# GitCrawler

This project is from GroundHog, I just changed it for my own purpose.

I modified it to get specific data for my project,like commits,changed_files and then save to the server.

Do some analysis and save useful data to database for this website.

I just want to say thank you to https://github.com/spgroup/groundhog and GitHub APIs.

It helps me a lot!
